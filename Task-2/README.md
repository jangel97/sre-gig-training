## Assignment

Note - Make sure to use functions/modular code wherever possible.
1. Generate a random number between 1 and 100
If the number is higher than 50 print "It's closer to 100"
If the number is lower than 50 print "It's closer to 0"
Print the generated random number
2. Modify the previous code to print "It's 50!" if the random number is 50
3. Modify the conditional in the code you previously wrote to check not only if the  number is higher than 50, but also if it's even. If it's even and higher than 50, print,"It's closer to 100, and it's even!"
